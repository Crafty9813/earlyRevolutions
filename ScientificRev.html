    <h1>The Scientific Revolution</h2>

    <!--INTRO PARAGRAPH-->
    <p id = "ScientificRevIntroP">The Scientific Revolution was a time period (approx. 1500 - 1700) during 
        the Renaissance where Europeans shifted away from religious thinking and instead focused more on 
        scientific reasoning.

        <figcaption>Leonardo Da Vinci's Mona Lisa, golden ratio shown</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p id = "MonaLisaP">An example of mathematical patterns found in Leonardo Da Vinci's paintings.
        The golden ratio was first discovered by Euclid, a Greek mathematician. Paintings
        started to use it, showing mathematical thinking of things during this time period.
        This is an example of a person (Da Vinci) and ideas (mathematical thinking). Leonardo Da Vinci
        was trying to make scientific concepts for flight, including ornithopters, "helicopters",
        etc. which all sadly didn't really work, (probably except for the parachute) but it paved 
        the way for scientific reasoning later on for people like the Wright Brothers who used airfoils 
        that were a concept found in a lot of flying concepts Da Vinci thought of. Da Vinci was a key
        figure during the Renaissance, helping with a lot of scientific concepts not limited to the above.

    <!--RENAISSANCE-->
    <h3>More Renaissance: the Plague, Printing Press, etc.</h3>

    <p id = "RenaissanceP">The Renaissance is a really big impactful event for influencing the Scientific Revolution.
        People like Da Vinci (Above) helped pave the way for future scientific innovations.
        The "Black Death" or plague started to make many turn to secularism or skepticism,
        questioning why god would let such a horrible event occur and let many die. This started to make people
        focus more on medicine and the human body, in order to cure diseaases. The Renaissance
        really started to make people start to turn away from religious beliefs and think more about
        using evidence, reasoning, and scientific knowledge to understand the world around us. With the more efficient printing press
        invented by Johann Gutenberg, many ideas and knowledge started to spread faster, not limited to science. People like Rene Descartes
        (France) and Francis Bacon (England) created the scientific method which would then be used in further scientific
        development.

    <!--PEOPLE SECTION-->
    <h2>Some Key Scientific People Who Influenced the Scientific Revolution</h2>

    <!--ISAAC NEWTON-->

        <figcaption id = "isaac-newton-caption">Isaac Newton, source: Wikapedia</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p class = "peopleParagraphs">Isaac Newton was an English mathematician, physicist, astronomer, one of the fathers of calculus, 
        etc. who made the laws of motion, <br> discovered gravity, created reflecting telscopes, and much more.
    </p>


    <!--NICOLAUS COPERNICUS-->
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/Copernicus.jpg" alt = "Nicolaus Copernicus" id = "NCopernicusImg">
        <figcaption id = "NCopernicusCaption">Nicolaus Copernicus, source: Wikapedia</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p class = "peopleParagraphs">Nicolaus Copernicus was a Polish astronomer and mathematician who proposed the heliocentric
        model of the solar system, <br> which used the sun as the center of our solar system instead of the earth, which 
        was previously used.
    </p>


    <!--GALILEO-->
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/Galileo.jpg" alt = "Galileo Galilei" id = "GalileoImg">
        <figcaption id = "GalileoCaption">Galileo Galilei, source: Wikapedia</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p class = "peopleParagraphs"> Galileo Galilei was an Italian astronomer, physicist, mathematician, and philosopher
        who used a telescope to prove that <br> Nicolaus Copernicus was right about the heliocentric theory.
    </p>


    <!--KEPLER-->
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/JKepler.jpg" alt = "Johannes Kepler" id = "KeplerImg">
        <figcaption id = "KeplerCaption">Johannes Kepler, source: Wikapedia</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p class = "peopleParagraphs"> Johannes Kepler was a German astronomer, mathematician, and writer who confirmed 
            Copernicus' heliocentric theory using math <br> and his own laws of planetary motion unlike Galileo who 
            actually saw it using a telescope.
