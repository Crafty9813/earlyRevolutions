    <h1>The Scientific Revolution</h1>

    <!--INTRO PARAGRAPH-->
    <p id="ScientificRevIntroP">
      The Scientific Revolution was a time period (approx. 1500 - 1700) during
      the Renaissance where Europeans shifted away from religious thinking and
      instead focused more on scientific reasoning.

    <p id="MonaLisaP">
      An example of mathematical patterns found in Leonardo Da Vinci's
      paintings. The golden ratio was first discovered by Euclid, a Greek
      mathematician. Paintings started to use it, showing mathematical thinking
      of things during this time period. This is an example of a person (Da
      Vinci) and ideas (mathematical thinking). Leonardo Da Vinci was trying to
      make scientific concepts for flight, including ornithopters,
      "helicopters", etc. which all sadly didn't really work, (probably except
      for the parachute) but it paved the way for scientific reasoning later on
      for people like the Wright Brothers who used airfoils that were a concept
      found in a lot of flying concepts Da Vinci thought of. Da Vinci was a key
      figure during the Renaissance, helping with a lot of scientific concepts
      not limited to the above.

    <!--RENAISSANCE-->

      More Renaissance: the Plague, Printing Press, etc.
    </h3>

    <p id="RenaissanceP">
      The Renaissance is a really big impactful event for influencing the
      Scientific Revolution. People like Da Vinci (Above) helped pave the way
      for future scientific innovations. The "Black Death" or plague started to
      make many turn to secularism or skepticism, questioning why god would let
      such a horrible event occur and let many die. This started to make people
      focus more on medicine and the human body, in order to cure diseaases. The
      Renaissance really started to make people start to turn away from
      religious beliefs and think more about using evidence, reasoning, and
      scientific knowledge to understand the world around us. With the more
      efficient printing press invented by Johann Gutenberg, many ideas and
      knowledge started to spread faster, not limited to science. People like
      Rene Descartes (France) and Francis Bacon (England) created the scientific
      method which would then be used in further scientific development.

    <h2>Some Key Scientific People Who Influenced the Scientific Revolution</h2>

    <!--ISAAC NEWTON-->

    <p class="peopleParagraphs">
      Isaac Newton was an English mathematician, physicist, astronomer, one of
      the fathers of calculus, etc. who made the laws of motion, discovered
      gravity, created reflecting telscopes, and much more. Hes probably the
      most famous for his universal law of gravitation, which states that
      everything in the universe attracts each other with a force directly
      proportional to the product of the objects' masses and inversely
      proportional to the square of the distance between their COM. Basically,
      gravity is strongest when 2 objects have a lot mass and the distance
      between them is small. If they are further apart or lighter, gravity is
      less strong.

    </figure>

    <p class="peopleParagraphs">
      Nicolaus Copernicus was a Polish astronomer and mathematician who proposed
      the heliocentric model of the solar system, which used the sun as the
      center of our solar system instead of the earth, which was previously
      used. In addition to having a major contribution to astronomy, he also
      studied medicine. During the time period, many actually thought that
      astronomy and the position of planets in orbit impacted humans and
      illnesses.

    <!--GALILEO-->

    <p class="peopleParagraphs">
      Galileo Galilei was an Italian astronomer, physicist, mathematician, and
      philosopher who made the best refracting telescope at the time to prove
      that Nicolaus Copernicus was right about the heliocentric theory. He
      observed the moon's craters & mountains, the sun's dark spots, Jupiter's
      moons, the rings of saturn, how the milky way galaxy consisted of a ton of
      stars, and more. He also studied motion and kinematics, to try to
      understand more about how forces acted on things (in earth) by
      experimenting with inclined planes. He discovered Inertia, and later on
      Isaac Newton created the law of inertia (Newton's 1st law).

    <!--KEPLER-->

    <p class="peopleParagraphs">
      Johannes Kepler was a German astronomer, mathematician, and writer who
      confirmed Copernicus' heliocentric theory using math and his own laws of
      planetary motion unlike Galileo who actually saw it using a telescope.
      Kepler explained the movement of planets around the sun through his laws
      of planetary motion. He described how (1) planet orbits aren't perfect
      circles, they are more of an ellipse, and that the sun is at one focus.
      So, the distance of the planet to the sun varies significantly unless the
      orbit is more circular, or the foci are closer to the center. (2) that a
      planet sweeps the same amount of area (portion of the ellipse area by a
      line connecting the earth to the sun) in the same amount of time (3) that
      the square of a planet's orbital period (the time it takes to make 1
      revolution) is proportional to the cube of half the length of the orbit's
      major axis (longer "diameter") of the ellipse.
