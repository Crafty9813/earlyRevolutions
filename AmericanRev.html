    <p class="AmericanRevIntroP">There is quite a lot of relationship actually. During the Protestant
        Reformation, many Puritans started <br> to move to the Americas in search of religious freedom. They didn't like
        how the churches in England <br> were too Catholic. An example is the Mayflower, where Puritans were treated 
        badly by King James I,<br> so they sailed to America. This mindset of wanting freedom and independence
        later on spread to the <br> American Revolution! The 13 colonies started to form because of this.</p>
