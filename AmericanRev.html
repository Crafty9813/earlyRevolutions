    <p id="protestant-reform-p">During the Protestant Reformation, many Puritans started to move to the Americas in 
        search of <br> religious freedom. They didn't like how the churches in England  were too Catholic. An example
        <br> is the Mayflower, where Puritans were treated badly by King James I, so they sailed to America. <br> This
        mindset of wanting freedom and independence later on spread to the American Revolution! <br> The 13 colonies started 
        to form because of this. This is how people, ideas, and events all come <br> together, as the Puritans (people) had 
        their own beliefs (ideas), and as a result moved to the <br> Americas (event) and with other protestant or catholics, 
        created colonies. But then the <br> American Revolution happened because people were mad about the taxes and 
        tyrant-like king.

    <!--ENGLAND MONARCHY-->
    <h2 id = "england-monarchy-h">How England's Constitutional Monarchy & Rulers Influenced the American Revolution</h2>

    <p id="england-monarchy-p">Throughout England's history, a lot of issues with rulers occured. This was mainly
        due to religious disagreement between Catholics and Protestants. For example, Edward VI was protestant,
        but when he died his sister Mary I came to throne and forced Roman Catholicism to churches. She was brutal
        to Protestants, and executed many, which led her to be known as "Bloody Mary". Many protestants wanted to
        rebel and stop Mary from marrying Phillip II of Spain, because both were Catholic. So, the Wyatt's rebellion 
        occured where Thomas Wyatt led a lot of men to protest and attempt to get people to join the group. Although
        some rebellions like this one failed, it generally motivated people to "fight-back" and be independent,
        and overthrow evil and corrupt rulers.
        <br>
        <br>
        Later on, England became a constitutional monarchy instead of an absolute monarchy. This meant
        the rulers had less power because they too had laws they needed to follow. A Bill of Rights was created in 1689,
        similar to how the Bill of Rights with 10 amendments were created after the American Revolution. The Bill of Rights
        included the below:
    </p>


    <ul>
        <li>No suspending/not following parliament laws</li>
        <li>No levying of taxes without grant from parliament</li>
        <li>No interfering with freedom of speech in Parliament</li>
        <li>No penalty for citizens who protested/voted against the king</li>
    </ul>


    <!--ENLIGHTENMENT-->

    <h2 id = "enlightenmentH" >How the Enlightenment & Scientific Revolution Influenced the American Revolution</h2>
    <p id = "enlightenment-p">The enlightenment was a time period after the Scientific Revolution, but
        before the American Revolution, where people were already thinking scientifically and reasoning instead, and the ideas
        during the enlightenment influenced the colonists during the American Revolution such as independence, people mattering more,
        and better governments which were more fair to the people, as colonists were mad that the British government taxed them,
        and didn't listen their voices. People during this time period were starting to challege authorities and question
        their actions because they didn't only care about religion anymore, and they questioned corrupt churches.

        he advocated for America's independence from Britain. He helped on things like signing and creating Declaration of Independence.
