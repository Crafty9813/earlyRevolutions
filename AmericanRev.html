    <p id="protestant-reform-p">
      During the Protestant Reformation, many Puritans started to move to the
      Americas in search of <br />
      religious freedom. They didn't like how the churches in England were too
      Catholic. An example <br />
      is the Mayflower, where Puritans were treated badly by King James I, so
      they sailed to America. <br />
      This mindset of wanting freedom and independence later on spread to the
      American Revolution! <br />
      The 13 colonies started to form because of this. This is how people,
      ideas, and events all come <br />
      together, as the Puritans (people) had their own beliefs (ideas), and as a
      result moved to the <br />
      Americas (event) and with other protestant or catholics, created colonies.
      But then the <br />
      American Revolution happened because people were mad about the taxes and
      tyrant-like king.

      How the Iroquois' Government Structure Influenced the Government Made by

    <p id="iroquois-p">
      The Iroquois were an early civilization in the Americas, and they had a
      strong form of government with 2 houses, 50 delegates, and a sense of
      democracy where everything was agreed on first by everyone. The iroquois
      had 5 groups: Cayuga, Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, and Seneca, and it sort of
      is like states coming together to agree on issues. In the image above,
      leaders from each tribe are discussing with each other. These all were
      things used later in the U.S. constitution, and people like Benjamin
      Franklin even give recognition/credits to the Iroquois Confederacy.

    <!--ENGLAND MONARCHY-->
    <h2 id="england-monarchy-h">
      How England's Constitutional Monarchy & Rulers Influenced the American
      Revolution
    </h2>

    <p id="england-monarchy-p">
      Throughout England's history, a lot of issues with rulers occured. This
      was mainly due to religious disagreement between Catholics and
      Protestants. For example, Edward VI was protestant, but when he died his
      sister Mary I came to throne and forced Roman Catholicism to churches. She
      was brutal to Protestants, and executed many, which led her to be known as
      "Bloody Mary". Many protestants wanted to rebel and stop Mary from
      marrying Phillip II of Spain, because both were Catholic. So, the Wyatt's
      rebellion occured where Thomas Wyatt led a lot of men to protest and
      attempt to get people to join the group. Although some rebellions like
      this one failed, it generally motivated people to "fight-back" and be
      independent, and overthrow evil and corrupt rulers.
      <br />
      <br />
      Later on, England became a constitutional monarchy instead of an absolute
      monarchy. This meant the rulers had less power because they too had laws
      they needed to follow. A Bill of Rights was created in 1689, similar to
      how the Bill of Rights with 10 amendments were created after the American
      Revolution. The Bill of Rights included the below:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>No suspending/not following parliament laws</li>
      <li>No levying of taxes without grant from parliament</li>
      <li>No interfering with freedom of speech in Parliament</li>
      <li>No penalty for citizens who protested/voted against the king</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="enlightenmentH">
      How the Enlightenment & Scientific Revolution Influenced the American
      Revolution
    </h2>
    <p id="enlightenment-p">
      The enlightenment was a time period after the Scientific Revolution, but
      before the American Revolution, where people were already thinking
      scientifically and reasoning instead, and the ideas during the
      enlightenment influenced the colonists during the American Revolution such
      as independence, people mattering more, and better governments which were
      more fair to the people, as colonists were mad that the British government
      taxed them, but didn't listen their voices. People during this time period
      were starting to challege authorities and question their actions because
      they didn't only care about religion anymore, and they questioned corrupt
      churches.

    <p id="john-adams-p">
      John Adams was a founding father and the 2nd president of the U.S. During
      the Enlightenment, he advocated for America's independence from Britain.
      He helped on things like signing and creating Declaration of Independence,
      was the governor of Massachusetts, and helped George Washington by
      establishing the navy for the Continental Army.

    <!--JOHN LOCKE-->

    <p id="john-locke-p">
      John Locke was a key person who influenced the thought of fighting for
      natural rights and overthrowing a government that wasn't fair and didn't
      protect the people. If the government didn't protect the people, why
      should they lose some of their rights to them? The colonists used this
      idea to help create the Declaration of Independence.

    <p id="montesquieu-p">
      Baron de Montesquieu was a French philosopher and judge who influenced the
      U.S. constitution by his idea where government is seperated into different
      powers like the legislative, judicial, and executive branches, all serving
      different roles like creating laws, passing them through the judicial
      branch to be judged, and then actually enforcing them through the
      executive branch.
