    <h2>
      Which of the developments we studied (people, ideas, events) are
      contributors to the revolutions that come out of this time period?
      (American, French, Haitian, Scientific), what are the most important
      specific examples of these people, ideas, or events?

      Note: I'm not an expert at all in each revolution, in fact I'm probably
      the least person in the whole world (literally) to be knowledgable. I'm
      just trying to pass my class.
